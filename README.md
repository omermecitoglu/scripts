# Scripts

This repo contains several helper scripts.

## Usage

Before running any of the scripts, you need to make them executable.  
You can do this using the included `make-executable.sh` script:

```bash
chmod +x make-executable.sh
./make-executable.sh
````

This will recursively find every `.sh` file under the current directory and add executable permissions.

After that, you can run any script directly, for example:

```bash
./fix-bash.sh
```
